## Prerequisites:
- Download the latest US Zips dataset from https://simplemaps.com/data/us-zips (choose the free tier). The dataset has approximately 33k entries.
- Create a MongoDB instance. You may use your own MongoDB Atlas instance in cloud or use a local instance. For local instances Docker is preferred, but you may also choose to install MongoDB as a standalone server on your OS.
- Import the dataset into the MongoDB instance.


## Requirements:
 a) Get the states with a total population of over 10 million.
  
 b) Get the average city population by state.

 c) Get the largest and the smallest city in each state.

 d) Get the largest and the smallest counties in each state.
